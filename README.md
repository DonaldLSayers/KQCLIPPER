# KQCLIPPER
a simple ESP8266 program that will create a twitch clip and post it to a discord channel.

You will have to generate a twitch access_token and a webhook for your discord channel.

Chere is a web interface that you can change the Twitch Channel you are clipping. I'm not saving it to eprom so it will go back to your default ID on reboot.

I will upload my 3d printable files soon.
